1.I created a table and listed 5 skin care products called SK-II, CeraVe, Ordinary, ESTEE, LAMAR. And I checked the price data online to put it in the price list. As some products are expensive. 
Here is the link of the invoice:
https://github.com/AnniHu95/ITM-352-repo/blob/main/WOD/Invoice1/invoice.html
2. I had 2 attempts. The first time the items in the script tag is not working and showing, also the Subtotal and Tax and Total price are not showing as well. So basically, the information from the script at the beginning was not showing. So I asked the professor’s help, as it turned out to be miss spelling, and I had this problem before in browser histories 1-3 I should have pay more attention about spelling. The other problem I faced was decimal limits. .toFixed code was the correct one, but I didn’t know how and where to put it to limit the numbers, and after the professor helped I know that because we are trying to limit the numbers, so we can directly add it into the script numbers. As I didn’t know is that you can put toFixed code into the document. Write code as well!
3. I think the things need to prepare are the products name, and price, you need these to edit before coding, and you need to know basic knowledge of the new thing that is limit the decimals. 
4.I think the first time I could have change the names by doing find and change, that way would help better and faster to change things. But I did it the second time which saved a lot of time as well. I didn’t know we can use different products and names to do this assignment.
