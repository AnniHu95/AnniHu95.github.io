  <p>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</p>

<p>First of all, plan things before I start anything, except the instruction, I need to read thoroughly and understand what it is letting me to do, list out the requirements, because the instructions sometimes would not be as clear or as step I wanted, so just list out the requirements, and then order them in a logic or way that I wanted.</p>

<p>Second of all, building a comment hobby, I didn’t have leaving comments in my codes, one of the reasons is that I didn’t know we can do so. However, it is a good way to clarify things.</p>

<p>Third of all, check changes before making the next change or step. I have this hobby long before I take this class, but I didn’t do as often as comparing to now, I do check often.</p>

<p>Lastly, make comment to notes, sometime during labs, I will turn codes into comments which it is required to delete, and I will turn it into comments and leave a note of what that code is about or its function.</p>

<p>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</p>

<p>I need to comment why did I put this code here, or how does this code help generate the rest of the codes.
I need to review some of the previous work so that I can understand better, and review the readings.</p>

<p>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</p>

<p>I barely copy from the screencast when doing WODs, I will always make sure myself doing WODs without screencasts, but I will learn from the screencast, instead of just figuring out by myself.</p>

<p>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</p>

<p>The labs helps me learn, when the professor give more instructions, and explanations, I am able to complete the labs by myself, but I don’t feel confident when the professor couldn’t finish explaining labs during class, and we had to figure it out by ourselves, then finish the part on our own.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</p>

<p>I learned a lot from Assignment 1, and it feels like I finished a lab by my own, except I had help from the professor, and I started it on scratch, and I didn’t know what to do at first, after getting a bit help, I knew what to do. For Assignment 2, I feel like the same as Assignment1, is that we need to be prepared before assignment 2 instead just work on it on our own when we are not as that knowledge.</p>

<p>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</p>

<p>May be if we can finish the labs, then it would be better. Because this course has pre-request, which is ICS 101, and in that course, HTML is included, so I think if we could have longer time for the lately labs, then we won’t be as struggled as now.</p>

<p>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
WODs, defiantly helps, because it’s similar to a summary of the labs.</p>

<p>Labs, for sure, we need the professor to explain and guide us.
Screencasts, instead of copying, since I barely copy from it, I feel it very helpful, because sometimes, out of labs, it can help me study.
One on one help, I think like ICS 101, if this course has open lab hours, which TAs or teachers set a period to provide help to the students.But the professor has been very helpful already.
I never work with classmates, but I often help them, this helps me, too. Because it gives me a fresh eye of understanding things, and by explaining it towards others, can help myself clear up my own understanding.</p>
