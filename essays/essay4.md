1.	My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
First of all, plan things before I start anything, except the instruction, I need to read thoroughly and understand what it is letting me to do, list out the requirements, because the instructions sometimes would not be as clear or as step I wanted, so just list out the requirements, and then order them in a logic or way that I wanted.
Second of all, building a comment hobby, I didn’t have leaving comments in my codes, one of the reasons is that I didn’t know we can do so. However, it is a good way to clarify things.
Third of all, check changes before making the next change or step. I have this hobby long before I take this class, but I didn’t do as often as comparing to now, I do check often.
Lastly, make comment to notes, sometime during labs, I will turn codes into comments which it is required to delete, and I will turn it into comments and leave a note of what that code is about or its function.
2.	I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
I need to comment some why did I put this code here, or how does this code help generate the rest of the codes.
I need to review some of the previous work so that I can understand better, and review the readings.
3.	I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
I barely copy from the screencast when doing WODs, I will always make sure myself doing WODs without screencasts, but I will learn from the screencast, instead of just figuring out by myself.
4.	The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
The labs helps me learn, when the professor give more instructions, and explanations, I am able to complete the labs by myself, but I don’t feel confident when the professor couldn’t finish explaining labs during class, and we had to figure it out by ourselves, then finish the part on our own.
5.	I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
I learned a lot from Assignment 1, and it feels like I finished a lab by my own, except I had help from the professor, and I started it on scratch, and I didn’t know what to do at first, after getting a bit help, I knew what to do. For Assignment 2, I feel like the same as Assignment1, is that we need to be prepared before assignment 2 instead just work on it on our own when we are not as that knowledge.
6.	I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
May be if we can finish the labs, then it would be better. Because this course has pre-request, which is ICS 101, and in that course, HTML is included, so I think if we could have longer time for the lately labs, then we won’t be as struggled as now.
7.	What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
WODs, defiantly helps, because it’s similar to a summary of the labs.
Labs, for sure, we need the professor to explain and guide us.
Screencasts, instead of copying, since I barely copy from it, I feel it very helpful, because sometimes, out of labs, it can help me study.
One on one help, I think like ICS 101, if this course has open lab hours, which Tas or teachers set a period to provide help to the students.
I never work with classmates, but I often help them, this helps me, too. Because it gives me a fresh eye of understanding things, and by explaining it towards others, can help myself clear up my own understanding.
