1.	Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details.
Introduction of Assignment 2:
My assignment is about a cloth store that is based on Korean style and fashion. But for customers from outside of Korea, they couldn’t find any stores that sells Korean style of fashion and even couldn’t find the exact same cloth as the celebrity, which they like. Our store providing an opportunity and options for these people to wear celebrity like and to wear the fashion they appreciate. And the product will directly come from Korea, that is why its shipment is expensive, but the cloth itself is not as expensive. I named it as “Kitty” that came from Korean Trend, which short for KT. 
There is a home page where I display the products and the customers can purchase items from. For this assignment I choose 5 products, that can represent our store style, which are spring special set, summer special set, fall special set, winter special set and whole year special set. 
After the customer done choosing products and entering the amount they wanted, it will lead them to the login page, which obviously you need a membership in order to finish your purchase. 
Here we divide customers into two parts, one is those who has a membership, they may login by entering the correct email address and password. One is those who doesn’t have a membership and needs to sign up or register for, if so they and click on the register button to lead them to the registration page, after entering the registration email address, their full name for user name, and the password, they may not change their user name and email address from here on, however, they may successfully login and go the next step of purchasing. 
And now they will be in the invoice page, in here they will see what product they choose and purchase, and the shipment, tax, and the total to spend. This page also tells them they had successfully logged in by saying “Welcome to ‘their name’s invoice page”, and their information, the last time they logged in and how many time as well.
They can also change the password here, by clicking the change password button, and in the change password page, as mentioned they will not be able to change their user name and email address, but they can only change password, and click on the save button, it will bring them back to the invoice page. 
Lastly, they can click on the confirm purchase button, to confirm their purchase. Which lead them to the confirmation page, telling them they had successfully log out by saying “their name have successfully logged out”, and their information, and the last time they logged in and how time as well.

2.	What did you learn from this assignment?
I learned that how important the process of pre-design is, because we should have an idea of what exactly we want our webpage looks like, and how it works and functions, so pre-design and outlining the things that needs to be done would help save time as well. 
About coding, I feel like I have improved a lot and understand many of the chapters this semester, such as algorithms, and server and processing, data storing, and having a general idea of how things work between server and client sides.

3.	Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
No, I did not work with a partner.
4.	How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
I got help from the professor, but mostly from online. What really helped me is that the articles online, for example, I needed help with validating the password, all I can think about is doing a “if” function, but the Assignment 2 page provided us a few links of articles and methods, I read through it and understand that I can use a function code, that the name of the function can be vary, which means that you can name it on your own! That surprised me, and opened my mind, so I used a lot of function in my registration page as well! 
I needed help with the requirement about protecting the invoice page, however I only thought about using easy ways such as “guard”, which I seek help online and yet I couldn’t figure out the solution, so I went seek help from the professor, and he solved it within 15mins, by just doing a “if” function, and redirect. 
I had problem about email case sensitive, and I searched online and I got the idea and format of the “case sensitive” part, and so I used a “if” function to meet the requirement.
I was trying to do the IR2 for extra credit, and the requirement is that the password should have at least one number and one special character. And I searched online about what represent number and special character in javascript and I saw the symbols and applying them into a “if” function and it worked! 
Thus, all in all, in my general experience I learned how to code and solve small problems by myself, but yes, sometimes I might get stuck into my own thought that I need help with, or I’m doing things in a complicated way and by getting help from the professor, it sure helps and save time.
5.	How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
From the perspective of the purpose of these two assignments. The assignment 1 was simply doing a fundamental process of purchasing, but this assignment helps protecting the person who is purchasing the product as well as protecting the store itself. 
From the perspective of coding matter. The assignment 1 was about getting familiar with server and processing, javascript, JASON, query, application developing, function, conditional expression and looping, objects and arrays. And assignment 2 is about advanced server and processing,  function, and more algorithms, and file system and file I/O. So basically something we learned from class, but more advanced.
6.	Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
(a). Thinking about how to do something: I estimated like 10-15%
(b). Writing code: I estimated like 80-70%.
(c). Testing and debugging: : I estimated like 10-15%.
7.	Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
The problem-solving part worked well, since we have a lot of problems, I now know that we can solve the problem by searching online for some key words, and learn from the previous works. Although it took me a long time to figure it out and make it work, at least it feels like I’m making progress.
The testing and debugging part took me a long time, because I needed to figure out why and which part is not working, so I had to test out step by step, and correcting the codes.
8.	If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
I hope I can ask the professor more about some of the requirements, because when I was trying to figure out some of the requirements and it took me like a whole afternoon to make it work, and fix it, and the professor fixed it and helped me on it within 20-30mins. So I feel like I should ask him for help more.
